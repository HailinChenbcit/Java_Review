  1. Arraylist is reference data type, Parent class -> Object
  2. A container for multiple elements
  3. ArrayList object in heap
  4. All elements in one Arraylist type should be the same
  5. in Java, array length is immutable
  6. Memory address is continuous
  7. It is hard to find large continuous space in memory (not good for large array)
